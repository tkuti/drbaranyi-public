# Fullstack Api Exam Project 1

## Story

You're halfway there! For your exam at the end of the course, you will need to create a fullstack containerized web application. For now, your job is to create a foundation for it.
Just like for any other project, you will need to create a plan first, after reading through the requirements carefully.

Example projects:
- vaccination location
- webshop
- traveling agency
- food ordering
- train ticket purchasing

## What are you going to learn?

- how to plan for a new project
- how to write User Stories
- about Service Design
- about Product Infrastructure
- about Software Architecture
- how to create a High Fidelity Wireframe

## Tasks

1. Pick a theme and write a short summary for the project (title, steps of implementation, etc...), and send it to the mentors for approval.
    - The student has a theme for the project
    - There is a short comprehensive summary containing all the important information about the project
    - The theme and the summary has been sent to the mentors and has been approved by them

2. Write User Stories for the project.
    - There are User Stories, in which the end goals of the project are expressed in a few sentences

3. Plan the project using Service Design and Product Infrastructure best practices, and create a concept for the Software Architecture.
    - There is a concept for the Software Architecture

4. Create a High Fidelity Wireframe for the project.
    - There is a High Fidelity Wireframe for the project

## General requirements

- The application is an administrative system
- The application uses model-service-component architecture
- MongoDB base, with at least 5 entities (e.g. product, order, customer, delivery, bill ...)
- NodeJS API, with at least 10 endpoints (e.g. /api/user, /api/product, /api/order ...)
- Angular or React frontend, with at least 5 pages (Bootstrap/Material or other templates are allowed)
- The application is dockerized, it can be run from a container
- The client side is responsive
